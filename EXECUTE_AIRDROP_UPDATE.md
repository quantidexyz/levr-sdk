## 🚀 Execution Command

**NEW: Combined Verification + Execution Script**

When ready to execute, run:

```bash
MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY= < your-key > bun run execute-airdrop-update
```

The script will:

1. ✅ Run **complete verification** (all 7 steps)
2. ✅ **Simulate entire flow** (updateMerkleRoot + claims) with state preserved
3. ✅ Display all configuration details
4. ⚠️ **Ask for confirmation** (must type "yes" exactly)
5. 🚀 **Execute using EXACT SAME data** that was verified

**What the script does:**

1. **Verification**: All 7 comprehensive checks
2. **Simulation**: Complete flow using [`simulateCalls`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/simulateCalls)
3. **Confirmation**: Must type "yes" to proceed
4. **Execution**: Updates merkle root + executes ALL claims
5. **Distribution**: All 75B tokens distributed to recipients

**Why use this approach?**

- **100% certainty**: Verification and execution use identical data
- **Complete automation**: Update + claims in single script run
- **No manual claiming**: All recipients get their tokens immediately
- **Stateful simulation**: Proves entire flow before execution
- **Safety**: Auto-cancels if ANY check fails

---

## 📋 No Manual Claiming Needed!

The script **automatically executes all claims** after updating the merkle root.

**Recipients will receive their tokens immediately** - no manual claiming required!

The script will display the claim transaction hashes:

```
📋 Claim Results:
   ✅ 0x83b4003eb22ede3e7fc60e8a5e58325ff61601dc: 33B claimed (Gas: 122752)
   ✅ 0xbc703b091045008e154237906c2ca724bf006adb: 22B claimed (Gas: 105637)
   ✅ 0x4b7ddac59ceec3de4706c460f34bbce758a58bed: 20B claimed (Gas: 83189)

✅✅✅ COMPLETE SUCCESS - ALL OPERATIONS EXECUTED! ✅✅✅

All 75B tokens have been distributed to recipients!
```

---

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

1. **This operation is IRREVERSIBLE**
   - Once executed, the merkle root cannot be changed back
   - Make sure you're ready before typing "yes"

2. **Environment Variables Required**

   ```bash
   MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY=<admin-private-key>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DRPC_API_KEY=<drpc-api-key>
   ```

3. **Double-Check Everything**
   - You're on Base Mainnet (Chain ID: 8453)
   - Using the correct admin private key
   - Safe multisig address is correct

4. **After Execution**
   - Save all transaction hashes (1 update + 3 claims)
   - Verify on BaseScan (check all 4 transactions)
   - Confirm recipients received their tokens
   - No further action needed - claims executed automatically!

## 🔍 What Will Happen

### Before (Current State)

- Merkle Root: `0x97189e5f795fc5841609acbd3da8e2ef8a0d3af491d602df32f9200548d68f9b`
- Includes **compromised treasury** address

### After (New State)

- Merkle Root: `0x2e58477c2e0f9280657b931b9dfef1e99fdb73524dad76c96346fdde51a1f30c`
- Includes **safe multisig** address: `0x4B7ddAc59cEeC3dE4706C460f34Bbce758a58bED`

### The Change

- Recipient 1 & 2: **UNCHANGED** (same addresses, same amounts)
- Treasury: **CHANGED** from compromised address to safe multisig
- Total allocation: **UNCHANGED** (still 75B tokens)

## 🎯 Final Checklist Before Execution

- [ ] I have reviewed the [AIRDROP_UPDATE_AUDIT.md](./AIRDROP_UPDATE_AUDIT.md) document
- [ ] I have verified all addresses are correct
- [ ] I have verified all amounts are correct (33B + 22B + 20B = 75B)
- [ ] I have my admin private key ready
- [ ] I understand this operation is irreversible
- [ ] I have saved the merkle proofs for recipients
- [ ] I am ready to execute

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

The script includes comprehensive error handling:

- ❌ If simulation fails → Script will NOT execute
- ❌ If state check fails → Script will NOT execute
- ❌ If you type anything other than "yes" → Script will NOT execute

**The transaction will ONLY execute if:**

1. ✅ All checks pass
2. ✅ Simulation succeeds
3. ✅ You explicitly type "yes" when prompted

---

**Last Verification**: October 28, 2025, 08:43 UTC
**Simulation Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Approval**: ✅ READY FOR EXECUTION

- [execute-airdrop-update.ts](./script/execute-airdrop-update.ts) - Combined verification + execution script

## 🎯 Stateful Simulation Verification

The combined script uses [`simulateCalls`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/simulateCalls) to verify the complete flow:

```
✅ Call 1: updateMerkleRoot()     Gas: 37,695   ✅
✅ Call 2: claim() Recipient 1    Gas: 122,752  ✅ (2 events)
✅ Call 3: claim() Recipient 2    Gas: 105,637  ✅ (2 events)
✅ Call 4: claim() Recipient 3    Gas: 83,189   ✅ (2 events)
```

**State is preserved between calls**, proving that:

- The update executes successfully
- The new merkle root becomes active immediately
- All recipients can claim their allocations
- Total gas: ~350k for complete flow

---

**YOU ARE CLEAR TO EXECUTE WHEN READY** ✅

**Recommended**: Use `bun run execute-airdrop-update` for maximum safety
